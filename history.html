	<p>SolarNetwork was studied as part of a Masters thesis titled <em>solarnetwork.net: 
	An Open Source Platform for Distributed Generation</em> by John Gorman in the 
	<a href="http://web.ece.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the 
	<a href="http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/">School of Engineering</a> at the 
	<a href="http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/">University of Auckland</a>, 
	New Zealand. The thesis was completed in March 2009 with First Class Honours.</p>
	
	<p>In June of 2008 Matt Magoffin met John and became interested in collaborating
	by open sourcing the software portion of John's thesis work. The initial code was 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/solarnetwork/">published on SourceForge</a> 
	in July. Then in October of 2012 the code <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork">moved 
	to GitHub</a>.</p>

	<p>In 2009 Philip Court began collaborating with SolarNetwork by identifying 
	synergies with the open source <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tumanako/">Tumanako</a>
	electric car project project, and later John, Matt, and Philip formed 
	<a href="http://greenstage.co.nz/power.html">Greenstage Power, Ltd.</a> to foster
	SolarNetwork's growth commercially.</p>
