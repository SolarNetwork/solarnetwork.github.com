John Gorman was invited to represent SolarNetwork at the White House
Energy Data Jam, hosted at the Standford University Business School
in Palo Alto, California. This was a meeting organized by the university, 
the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/),
an arm of the White House that "advises the President of the effects of science and technology
on domestic and international affairs" and the US Department of Energy. We
thought that Dan Reicher deserves a lot of kudos for hosting the
brainstorming session - bravo!
