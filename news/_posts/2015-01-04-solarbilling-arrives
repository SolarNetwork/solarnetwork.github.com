The SolarNetwork platform has been looking for an Open Source software platform to provide a billing solution for those who might want to create a distributed energy company (i.e. likely to be leveraging solar PV) under a traditional commercial or cooperative business model.  Well now we have it, leveraging a fork of the popular jbilling platform we have been creating our very own "fully" Open Source (Richard Stallman would say ["Free Software"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) as in freedom!) called [SolarBilling](http://greenstage.co.nz/SolarBilling/introduction.html).  This is a billing platform that integrates nicely with SolarNetwork and one which we can expand upon as needed.  We still have more work to do, so stay tuned as we progress this development...

Full source code for SolarBilling is available [here](https://github.com/SolarBilling/solar-billing).
