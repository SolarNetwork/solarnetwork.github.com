SolarNodes now have [OCPP support](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarNode-OCPP) and this functionality has been commissioned and signed off after testing with charge.net.nz back end billing systems. For context, check out Greenstage's implementation of this technology [here](http://greenstage.co.nz/evcharging.html).
