	<h1>SolarNetwork for enthusiasts.</h1>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is still being actively developed, and is currently in a
	limited beta-test phase of the project. You can use this page to learn how
	to configure a SolarNode, but to actually post data into SolarNet you'll 
	need an official account. You can request an account by flicking an email 
	to <a href="mailto:beta@solarnetwork.net">beta@solarnetwork.net</a>.</p>
	
	<p>All that being said, this page will tell you all you need to know to get started 
	creating your own SolarNode.</p>
	
	<h2>Before you begin</h2>
	
	<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/Node-Supported-Devices">
	node supported devices</a> page to see what devices SolarNetwork can talk to.
	Don't see something you wish was supported? Submit a <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/issues">feature
	request</a> or better yet become a <a href="developers.html">developer</a> and 
	contribute the support yourself (you'll be helping make the world a better place)!</p>
	
	<h2>Choose your SolarNode hardware</h2>
	 
	<p>The SolarNode hardware has three basic requirements:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li><p>The SolarNode application is written in Java, and requires a minimum of a 
			Java 6 runtime environment. Thus your SolarNode can be any hardware that 
			supports Java 6.</p></li>
		<li><p>Beyond that the SolarNode needs ways to talk to the devices you want to 
			monitor or control, for example: serial ports, USB ports, or WiFi.</p></li>
		<li><p>The SolarNode needs internet connectivity to  be able to post the data 
			up to SolarNet, for example: ethernet or WiFi connection to your home 
			network, 3G mobile via USB stick, etc.</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>We've had good success with the 
	<a href="http://www.norhtec.com/products/mcjrmx/index.html">JrMX</a> box 
	(see our page describing <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/Node-OS-Setup-Guide-Debian-6">how 
	to set up a full Debian Linux OS</a> on a JrMX), but have deployed SolarNodes on devices ranging from the
	<a href="http://www.embeddedarm.com/products/board-detail.php?product=TS-7260">TS-7260</a>
	to the <a href="http://www.designa-electronics.com/index.php/products/snapper-single-board-computers">Snapper 9260</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Install the SolarNode platform</h2>
	
	<p>See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/solarnetwork/files/node-framework/">SolarNode
	framework packages</a> page for downloadable packages (take care to read the <strong>README</strong>
	on that page). You'll need to download a <em>base node</em> package
	along with any other specific packages required by the devices you want to monitor.</p>
	
	<h2>SolarKiosk &mdash; showcase your SolarNode</h2>
	
	<p>The SolarNet service provides many easy ways to visualize your data using just a web 
	browser. If you'd like to build a kiosk, for example to display information about your
	SolarNode on a lobby TV screen, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/solarnetwork/files/solarkiosk/">SolarKiosk image</a> page for some
	example kiosk disk images.</p>
