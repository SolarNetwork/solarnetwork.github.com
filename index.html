	<h1>Energy. For the rest of us.</h1>

	<p>SolarNetwork is a framework for collecting and viewing information about 
	your personal or commercial energy production and consumption. Some applications of this 
	technology are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>See how much energy you consume over time.</li>
		<li>Find patterns in the ways you use energy, and then find ways to minimize your energy footprint.</li>
		<li>Track how much energy your solar panels produce over time.</li>
		<li>Compare your energy use (or production) to other people.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is also a framework for participating in "smart grid" electricity networks.
	Some applications of this technology are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Demand response &mdash; automatically adjust your electricity consumption in 
		response to grid operator requests (and get reimbursed for doing so).</li>
		
		<li>Market based pricing &mdash; pay for electricity when you use it (and 
		intelligently adapt to using electricity when the price is lowest).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How it works</h2>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is composed of two parts: a small internet-connected device that
	you install at home (we like to call them <em>SolarNodes</em>, or <em>nodes</em> for short),
	and a service "in the cloud" that the devices communicate with (we call this service 
	<em>SolarNet</em>).</p>
	
	<p>Thus, the general idea is that you get your hands on a node,
	configure it to communicate with your electricity meter, your solar inverter, 
	your battery charge controller, your weather station, etc, and let the node collect
	interesting information from those devices and store it in the SolarNet service. From
	there you have access to pre-built web pages to visualize your energy footprint, 
	compare your footprint to other users, and look for ways to maximize your energy efficiency.</p>
	
	<p>The SolarNet service also provides an easy API for developers or advanced enthusiasts
	 to build your own applications using the collected data.</p>

	<h2>Open to the core</h2>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is built entirely as open source software. We are passionate about
	open source in general, but believe even more strongly that the software interacting
	with your home and your energy network should be completely transparent.</p>
