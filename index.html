	<h1>Energy information, for the rest of us.</h1>

	<p>SolarNetwork is a framework for collecting and viewing information about 
	your personal or commercial energy production and consumption. Some applications of this 
	technology are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>See how much energy you consume over time.</li>
		<li>Find patterns in the ways you use energy, and then find ways to minimize your energy footprint.</li>
		<li>Track how much energy your solar panels produce over time.</li>
		<li>Compare your energy use (or production) to other people.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is also a framework for participating in "smart grid" electricity networks.
	Some applications of this technology are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Demand response &mdash; automatically adjust your electricity consumption in 
		response to grid operator requests (and get reimbursed for doing so).</li>
		
		<li>Market based pricing &mdash; pay for electricity when you use it (and 
		intelligently adapt to using electricity when the price is lowest).</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Note</strong> that although SolarNetwork has focused heavily on 
	<em>electric</em> energy, the platform has been designed with other systems
	in mind, such as water and natural gas.</p>

	<h2>How it works</h2>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is composed of two parts: a small internet-connected device that
	you install at home (we like to call them <em>SolarNodes</em>, or <em>nodes</em> for short),
	and a service "in the cloud" that the devices communicate with (we call this service 
	<em>SolarNet</em>).</p>

	<p>Thus, the general idea is that you get your hands on a node,
	configure it to communicate with your electricity meter, your solar inverter, 
	your battery charge controller, your weather station, etc, and let the node collect
	interesting information from those devices and store it in the SolarNet service. From
	there you have access to pre-built web pages to visualize your energy footprint, 
	compare your footprint to other users, and look for ways to maximize your energy efficiency.</p>
	
	<p>The SolarNet service also provides an easy API for developers or advanced enthusiasts
	 to build your own applications using the collected data.</p>

	<h2>What you see</h2>
	
	<p>As a participant in SolarNetwork what you will ultimately <em>see</em> are 
	interesting visualizations of all the data collected by your SolarNode. Perhaps 
	you'd like to see the electricity consumption of 
	a building <a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/cm/cm.html">broken down
	by individual circuits</a>:</p>
	
	<a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/cm/cm.html" title="SolarNetwork electricity consumption monitor">
		<img src="images/cm-1000.png" alt="cm-1000" width="500" height="364" 
			alt="SolarNetwork electricity consumption monitor"/></a>
	
	<p>Or just the overall consumption for a 
	<a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/cm/cm.html?nodeId=11">whole house</a>.
	If you've got solar panels as well, you might like to see
	<a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/solarviz/node-gen-dashboard.do?nodeId=30">your
	solar panel generation correlated to weather and market electricity prices</a>,
	focus solely on <a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/tau/tau.html">solar panel
	performance</a>, or convey your solar panel energy production in terms of
	<a href="http://data.solarnetwork.net/ck/opm/opm.html">CO<sub>2</sub>, diesel, and
	money saved</a>.</p>
	
	<p>There are many possibilities, and these examples were all built using the SolarNet web API, using HTML5
	technologies so they work in most any modern web browser. If you'd like to see
	your energy information in some other way, it is entirely possible!</p>

	<h2>Open to the core</h2>
	
	<p>SolarNetwork is built entirely as open source software. We are passionate about
	open source in general, but believe even more strongly that the software interacting
	with your home and your energy network should be completely transparent.</p>
